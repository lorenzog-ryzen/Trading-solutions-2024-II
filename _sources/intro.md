## Introduction to the Machine Learning Project

The rise of **Machine Learning** has transformed the financial landscape, providing innovative tools for decision-making in stock trading. In this context, the present project aims to explore the synergy between **neural networks** and **genetic algorithms** to develop a robust predictive model that optimizes trading strategies.

**Neural networks**, inspired by the functioning of the human brain, are capable of learning complex patterns from large datasets. Their ability to process and analyze information in a non-linear manner makes them a powerful tool for predicting stock market movements. This project focuses on the use of neural networks to model stock price behavior, leveraging historical data and relevant market features.

On the other hand, **genetic algorithms** are optimization techniques based on the principles of natural evolution. These algorithms can be used to tune the hyperparameters of neural networks, improving their performance and optimizing trading strategies. By simulating evolutionary processes, genetic algorithms efficiently explore the solution space, finding configurations that maximize the profitability of trading operations.

### Project Objectives

1. **Define the Problem**: Identify the specific problem in stock trading to be addressed, such as price prediction or the classification of buy/sell signals.
2. **Data Collection**: Compile a historical dataset that includes stock prices, trading volumes, and other financial indicators.
3. **Model Development**: Implement neural networks for the analysis and prediction of price movements, using supervised learning techniques.
4. **Optimization**: Apply genetic algorithms to adjust the hyperparameters of the neural network model, improving its accuracy and generalization capacity.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using relevant metrics and compare its performance with conventional trading strategies.
6. **Strategy Implementation**: Develop an automated trading system that integrates the predictive model, allowing the execution of operations based on the generated signals.

Through this project, we aim to demonstrate how the combination of neural networks and genetic algorithms can offer an innovative and effective approach to stock trading. Ultimately, the goal is not only to provide a functional model but also to contribute to the understanding of how these technologies can transform financial analysis and enhance investment profitability.
